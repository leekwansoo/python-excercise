    "Advantages of OOP\n",
    "Provides a clear structure to programs\n",
    "Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug\n",
    "Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n",
    "Allows you to build reusable applications with less code\n",
    "Tip: The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. Move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.\n",

    "Classes and objects are the two core concepts in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class. For example:\n",

    "In the next chapters, you will learn how to:\n",
