## üìä Types of Python Operators

Python provides several categories of operators:

| Category | Operators | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Arithmetic** | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**` | Mathematical calculations |
| **Assignment** | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=` | Assign and modify values |
| **Comparison** | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` | Compare values |
| **Logical** | `and`, `or`, `not` | Combine boolean expressions |
| **Identity** | `is`, `is not` | Test object identity |
| **Membership** | `in`, `not in` | Test membership in sequences |
| **Bitwise** | `&`, `\|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` | Bit-level operations |

---

## ‚ûï Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical calculations:

### Basic Operations:
```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {a + b}")        # 13
print(f"Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {a - b}")     # 7
print(f"Multiplication: {a} * {b} = {a * b}")  # 30
print(f"Division: {a} / {b} = {a / b}")        # 3.3333...
print(f"Floor Division: {a} // {b} = {a // b}") # 3
print(f"Modulus: {a} % {b} = {a % b}")         # 1
print(f"Exponentiation: {a} ** {b} = {a ** b}") # 1000
```

### Practical Examples:

#### Example 1: Temperature Conversion
```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    """Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit"""
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit

# Test the conversion
temp_c = 25
temp_f = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_c)
print(f"{temp_c}¬∞C = {temp_f}¬∞F")  # 25¬∞C = 77.0¬∞F
```

#### Example 2: Calculate Circle Properties
```python
import math

def circle_properties(radius):
    """Calculate area and circumference of a circle"""
    area = math.pi * radius ** 2
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
    return area, circumference

r = 5
area, circumference = circle_properties(r)
print(f"Circle with radius {r}:")
print(f"Area: {area:.2f}")
print(f"Circumference: {circumference:.2f}")
```

## üìù Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to variables and can combine assignment with arithmetic operations:

### Basic Assignment:
```python
x = 10          # Simple assignment
print(x)        # 10
```

### Compound Assignment (Shorthand):
```python
score = 100

# Traditional way vs compound assignment
score = score + 5    # Traditional
score += 5           # Compound (same result)

# All compound assignment operators
score += 10    # score = score + 10
score -= 5     # score = score - 5
score *= 2     # score = score * 2
score /= 3     # score = score / 3
score //= 2    # score = score // 2
score %= 7     # score = score % 7
score **= 2    # score = score ** 2

print(f"Final score: {score}")
```

### Practical Example: Bank Account
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.balance = initial_balance
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount  # Using += operator
        return self.balance
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
            self.balance -= amount  # Using -= operator
            return self.balance
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds!")
            return self.balance

# Test the account
account = BankAccount(1000)
print(f"Initial balance: ${account.balance}")

account.deposit(250)
print(f"After deposit: ${account.balance}")

account.withdraw(100)
print(f"After withdrawal: ${account.balance}")
```

---

## üîç Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare values and return boolean results:

```python
a = 10
b = 5
c = 10

# Equality and inequality
print(f"{a} == {c}: {a == c}")  # True
print(f"{a} != {b}: {a != b}")  # True

# Greater than and less than
print(f"{a} > {b}: {a > b}")    # True
print(f"{a} < {b}: {a < b}")    # False
print(f"{a} >= {c}: {a >= c}")  # True
print(f"{a} <= {b}: {a <= b}")  # False

# Chaining comparisons
age = 25
print(f"18 <= {age} <= 65: {18 <= age <= 65}")  # True
```

### Practical Example: Grade Calculator
```python
def get_letter_grade(score):
    """Convert numeric score to letter grade"""
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def evaluate_performance(score):
    """Evaluate student performance"""
    letter = get_letter_grade(score)
    
    if score >= 95:
        performance = "Excellent!"
    elif score >= 85:
        performance = "Very Good"
    elif score >= 75:
        performance = "Good"
    elif score >= 65:
        performance = "Satisfactory"
    else:
        performance = "Needs Improvement"
    
    return letter, performance

# Test with different scores
test_scores = [98, 87, 76, 65, 45]
for score in test_scores:
    grade, performance = evaluate_performance(score)
    print(f"Score: {score} ‚Üí Grade: {grade} ({performance})")
```

---

## üß† Logical Operators

Logical operators combine or modify boolean expressions:

### Basic Logical Operations:
```python
# and operator (both conditions must be True)
print(f"True and True: {True and True}")    # True
print(f"True and False: {True and False}")  # False

# or operator (at least one condition must be True)
print(f"True or False: {True or False}")    # True
print(f"False or False: {False or False}")  # False

# not operator (reverses the boolean value)
print(f"not True: {not True}")              # False
print(f"not False: {not False}")            # True
```

### Practical Example: Access Control System
```python
def check_access(age, has_id, is_member, is_vip=False):
    """Check if person can access the facility"""
    
    # Basic access requirements
    basic_access = age >= 18 and has_id
    
    # Membership access
    member_access = is_member and basic_access
    
    # VIP access (special privileges)
    vip_access = is_vip or (member_access and age >= 21)
    
    # Restricted areas (only for VIP members over 25)
    restricted_access = is_vip and age >= 25 and is_member
    
    return {
        "basic_access": basic_access,
        "member_access": member_access,
        "vip_access": vip_access,
        "restricted_access": restricted_access
    }

# Test different scenarios
scenarios = [
    {"name": "John", "age": 19, "has_id": True, "is_member": True, "is_vip": False},
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 26, "has_id": True, "is_member": True, "is_vip": True},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 17, "has_id": True, "is_member": False, "is_vip": False},
]

for person in scenarios:
    access = check_access(
        person["age"], 
        person["has_id"], 
        person["is_member"], 
        person["is_vip"]
    )
    print(f"\n{person['name']} (Age: {person['age']}):")
    for level, granted in access.items():
        status = "‚úÖ Granted" if granted else "‚ùå Denied"
        print(f"  {level.replace('_', ' ').title()}: {status}")
```

## üÜî Identity and Membership Operators

### Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`):
Test if two variables refer to the same object in memory:

```python
# Identity operators
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(f"a is b: {a is b}")       # False (different objects)
print(f"a is c: {a is c}")       # True (same object)
print(f"a == b: {a == b}")       # True (same content)

# Common use with None
value = None
if value is None:
    print("Value is None")

# Be careful with small integers and strings (Python optimizes these)
x = 5
y = 5
print(f"x is y: {x is y}")       # True (Python caches small integers)
```

### Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`):
Test if a value exists in a sequence:

```python
# Membership in lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(f"'apple' in fruits: {'apple' in fruits}")           # True
print(f"'orange' not in fruits: {'orange' not in fruits}") # True

# Membership in strings
text = "Python Programming"
print(f"'Python' in text: {'Python' in text}")            # True
print(f"'Java' not in text: {'Java' not in text}")        # True

# Membership in dictionaries (checks keys)
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
print(f"'name' in student: {'name' in student}")          # True
print(f"'Alice' in student: {'Alice' in student}")        # False (checks keys, not values)
```

### Practical Example: Content Filter
```python
def content_filter(text, banned_words, required_words=None):
    """Filter content based on banned and required words"""
    
    # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive checking
    text_lower = text.lower()
    
    # Check for banned words
    has_banned = any(word.lower() in text_lower for word in banned_words)
    
    # Check for required words (if specified)
    has_required = True
    if required_words:
        has_required = all(word.lower() in text_lower for word in required_words)
    
    # Determine if content passes filter
    passes_filter = not has_banned and has_required
    
    return {
        "passes_filter": passes_filter,
        "has_banned_content": has_banned,
        "has_required_content": has_required,
        "banned_found": [word for word in banned_words if word.lower() in text_lower],
        "required_missing": [word for word in (required_words or []) if word.lower() not in text_lower]
    }

# Test the content filter
test_content = "This is a great Python tutorial for beginners"
banned = ["spam", "fake", "scam"]
required = ["Python", "tutorial"]

result = content_filter(test_content, banned, required)
print(f"Content: '{test_content}'")
print(f"Passes filter: {result['passes_filter']}")
print(f"Banned words found: {result['banned_found']}")
print(f"Required words missing: {result['required_missing']}")
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Operator Precedence and Associativity

Understanding the order in which operators are evaluated is crucial for writing correct expressions:

### Precedence Order (Highest to Lowest):
```python
# 1. Parentheses (highest precedence)
result = (2 + 3) * 4  # = 5 * 4 = 20

# 2. Exponentiation (**)
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # = 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 2 ** 9 = 512

# 3. Unary operators (+, -, not)
result = -3 ** 2      # = -(3 ** 2) = -9

# 4. Multiplication, Division, Modulus (*, /, //, %)
result = 10 + 2 * 3   # = 10 + (2 * 3) = 16

# 5. Addition, Subtraction (+, -)
result = 10 - 2 + 3   # = (10 - 2) + 3 = 11 (left to right)

# 6. Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
# 7. Identity and membership operators (is, is not, in, not in)
# 8. Logical NOT (not)
# 9. Logical AND (and)
# 10. Logical OR (or) (lowest precedence)
```

### Practical Example: Complex Expression
```python
def calculate_final_price(base_price, tax_rate, discount_percent, is_member):
    """Calculate final price with complex pricing rules"""
    
    # Using proper operator precedence
    # 1. Calculate discount amount
    discount_amount = base_price * discount_percent / 100
    
    # 2. Apply member discount (additional 5% if member)
    member_discount = base_price * 0.05 if is_member else 0
    
    # 3. Calculate price after discounts
    discounted_price = base_price - discount_amount - member_discount
    
    # 4. Calculate tax on discounted price
    tax_amount = discounted_price * tax_rate / 100
    
    # 5. Final price
    final_price = discounted_price + tax_amount
    
    return {
        "base_price": base_price,
        "discount_amount": discount_amount,
        "member_discount": member_discount,
        "discounted_price": discounted_price,
        "tax_amount": tax_amount,
        "final_price": final_price
    }

# Test the calculation
price_breakdown = calculate_final_price(
    base_price=100.00,
    tax_rate=8.5,
    discount_percent=15,
    is_member=True
)

print("Price Breakdown:")
for key, value in price_breakdown.items():
    print(f"  {key.replace('_', ' ').title()}: ${value:.2f}")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Operator Pitfalls

### 1. Assignment vs Equality Confusion
```python
# Wrong - using assignment (=) instead of equality (==)
age = 18
if age = 18:  # SyntaxError!
    print("Adult")

# Correct - using equality operator
if age == 18:
    print("Adult")
```

### 2. Operator Precedence Mistakes
```python
# Problem - unexpected result due to precedence
result = 10 + 2 * 3  # Result: 16 (not 36!)

# Solution - use parentheses for clarity
result = (10 + 2) * 3  # Result: 36
```

### 3. Logical Operator Short-Circuiting
```python
def expensive_operation():
    print("This is expensive!")
    return True

# Short-circuiting behavior
result1 = True or expensive_operation()   # expensive_operation() not called
result2 = False and expensive_operation() # expensive_operation() not called
result3 = True and expensive_operation()  # expensive_operation() IS called
```

### 4. Identity vs Equality Confusion
```python
# Dangerous - comparing lists with 'is'
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

if list1 is list2:      # False - different objects
    print("Same object")

if list1 == list2:      # True - same content
    print("Same content")
```
